Installation
===========================================

Scaffold is installed like any other Django app::

    ?>pip install django-scaffold
    
or, if you can't use pip::

    ?>easy_install django-scaffold

or, if all else fails, place scaffold package where your python interpreter can find it and then 

When you have the package installed, add it to the list of apps in the INSTALLED_APPS setting of your `settings.py` file.
